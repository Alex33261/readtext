#'   
#'   A set of functions for  importing and handling text files and formatted
#'   text files with additional meta-data, such including .csv, .tab, .json,
#'   .xml, and others.
#'   
#'   \pkg{textfile} makes it easy to import text files in various formats, including 
#'   using operating system filemasks to load in groups of files based on glob pattern
#'   matches, including files in multiple directories or sub-directories.
#'   \pkg{textfile} can also read multiple files into R from compressed archive files such as 
#'   .gz, .zip, .tar.gz, etc.  Finally \pkg{textfile} reads in the document-level meta-data
#'   associated with texts, if those texts are in a format (e.g. .csv, .json) that includes
#'   additional, non-textual data.
